# Mandrill PHP API (Google App Engine Edition)

This is a fork of the handy [php wrapper](https://bitbucket.org/mailchimp/mandrill-api-php) for the
mandrill API, modified to work in the google app engine php5 runtime environment by using the URL
Fetch API instead of a currently buggy cURL implementation.
